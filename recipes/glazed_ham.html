        <p>This whole ham recipe features a glaze that boasts three things: wonderful flavor, a gorgeous appearance, and a crispy, crackling crust you can hear across the room. This easy-to-make glaze has all those things in abundance.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup water, or as needed</li>
            <li>2 whole star anise</li>
            <li>12 whole cloves, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 (7 pound) country-style ham</li>
            <li>1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup margarine, softened</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Prepare ham: Add water, star anise, and cloves to the bottom of a roasting pan. Place a roasting rack into the pan; place ham on the rack. Cut 1/4-inch-deep slashes, 1/2-inch apart, lengthwise and crosswise across the top of ham.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>While ham is baking, make glaze: Whisk together brown sugar, honey, mustard, vinegar, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne pepper in a medium bowl until thick and smooth.</li>
            <li>Brush glaze all over ham. Continue baking ham, brushing with glaze every 20 minutes, until glaze is deep golden and ham is heated through, about 2 hours 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of ham should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Run a kitchen torch over ham until glaze is crispy and caramelized, 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
