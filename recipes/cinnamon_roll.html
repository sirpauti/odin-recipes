        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Make homemade cinnamon rolls in 90 minutes with a soft, quick-rising dough.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup margarine, softened</li>
            <li>3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package instant yeast</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup margarine, softened</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 cup raisins (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat milk in a small saucepan until just hot to touch or a few bubbles form around the edge. Remove from heat and stir in margarine until melted; set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine 2 1/4 cups flour, white sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add milk mixture, water, and egg; beat well. Add remaining 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>While dough is resting, mix together brown sugar, margarine, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin pan.</li>
            <li>Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface into a 12x9-inch rectangle. Spread brown sugar mixture over dough; sprinkle with raisins.</li>
            <li>Roll up dough and pinch seam to seal. Cut into 12 equal rolls.</li>
            <li>Place cut-side up in the prepared muffin cups. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 20 minutes. Remove rolls from muffin cups to cool on a wire rack. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
